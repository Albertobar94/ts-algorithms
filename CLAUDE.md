# fullstack-engineering-interview-questions — project conventions

Personal full-stack interview-prep reference — algorithm patterns, front-end component
builds, JS/TS utility primitives, and JS/TS knowledge questions. Goal: **recognition over
memorization** — train the trigger that maps a problem (or real code in any stack) to the
right trick.

Audience voice: an engineer who codes with frameworks but never studied algorithms or
much math. **Plain words, no bare jargon** — ground every term the first time (explain
Big-O as loops, "Stack = last-in-first-out pile", etc.). Terse for general/navigation;
real depth only on the genuinely hard part, inline.

## Note format (REQUIRED — this is the preferred shape)

Each trick lives at `<family>/<trick>/` with a `README.md` + a `solution.ts`. The
README follows this order — **questions first, bug-focused pseudocode in the middle,
real example problems last**. Reference note: `techniques/search/binary-search/find-target/README.md`.

**Two axes, same note shape.** (1) Algorithm patterns under `techniques/` (e.g.
`techniques/search/binary-search/`, `techniques/hashing/`…), grouped into the super-categories
`techniques/`, `structures/`, `paradigms/` — navigated by *recognising which trick*; nesting
means "a more specific case of the parent."
(2) Front-end & full-stack interview solutions under `frontend/<category>/<trick>/` — the
GFE 75 classics and friends; nesting is plain categorisation, not "built-on." This axis
spans **implement-from-scratch JS/TS primitives** (ship a `solution.ts` — e.g. debounce),
**UI component builds** (React/TSX, possibly multi-file — ship the component file(s), plus
a `solution.ts` for any extractable pure logic — e.g. the Data Table's pagination), and
**JS/TS knowledge questions**. Same note shape throughout. References:
`frontend/rate-limiting/debounce/README.md` (primitive),
`frontend/pagination/data-table/README.md` (component build).

1. **Title** — `# <Trick> — <one-line plain gist>`
2. **## TL;DR**
   - **"Is it <trick>? Ask these — all yes → yes:"** the recognition test — the
     questions you run on a problem's words to decide if this trick applies. The last
     one is the real decider.
   - **"Before you code, pin down:"** the trick-specific clarifying questions.
   - **"The lines where bugs hide:"** a one-line list of the bug-critical decisions.
3. **## What it is** — plain explanation + a tiny worked example on real values.
4. **## What you track** — the variables, in familiar terms.
5. **## How it works** — pseudocode that is code-like but readable, with a **⚠️ on
   every bug-prone line** and the consequence of getting it wrong (off-by-one, infinite
   loop, wrong seed, overflow). Close with a one-line recap of those lines.
6. **## Picture** — a Mermaid flowchart.
7. **## Where you'll meet it (practice + recognition)** — LeetCode/other-platform
   problems with a one-line mapping, real-life examples in any stack, and a "looks like
   it but ISN'T" line naming the sibling trick + the question that tells them apart.
8. Footer link to `solution.ts`.

**Split families (a trick with sibling sub-notes).** When one trick fans out into sibling
variants (e.g. `sliding-window/` → `fixed-size/` · `variable-distinct/` · `shrink-to-target/`),
add **two extra pieces** so a reader landing on a child isn't dropped into the recognition
test with no context:
- an **overview README** at the parent folder (`<family>/<trick>/README.md`) — the shared
  idea, the **goal**, the N flavors as a table + a "which one?" decision guide, and a link to
  each child. Reference: `techniques/two-pointers/sliding-window/README.md`.
- a **context banner** atop each child — a blockquote **between the title and the TL;DR**:
  "N of M flavors — read the overview first", a one-line "this flavor: …", and the canonical
  problem. Reference: `techniques/two-pointers/sliding-window/fixed-size/README.md`.

Do **not** use the older sections "Spot it", "Two disguises", "Questions to ask",
"Go faster" — they're folded into TL;DR (questions), How it works (bug lines), and
Where you'll meet it (examples).

## solution.ts

- TypeScript, strict-clean (explicit return types, no `any`, `const` by default, double quotes, semicolons).
- Header doc comment carries ALL the reasoning: problem statement, approach, why-it-works, complexity, edge cases, and any language trap (e.g. JS `<<` is 32-bit).
- Lean on idiomatic JS built-ins where they don't change the Big-O — `Math.max`/`Math.min` for a running best, `arr.reduce` to seed a sum, `Map`/`Set` for membership. But keep the trick's **core step explicit** when collapsing it would hide the idea or blow up complexity (e.g. the O(1) window slide `sum += entrant − leaver` must stay a slide, never a per-window `reduce` → O(n·k)).
- Include the real LeetCode solution **and** a far-apart twin from a different domain.
- End with a runnable self-check guarded by `if (import.meta.url === \`file://${process.argv[1]}\`)`.
- **Component builds** (React/TSX) ship the component file(s) + any fixtures (e.g. `DataTable.tsx`, `data.ts`); keep the pure, testable logic in a `solution.ts` beside them so the self-check still covers the bug-prone math (the `.tsx` itself needs a React/JSX toolchain to run, so it stays a thin shell over that primitive).

## Verifying solutions

The repo has no TS toolchain yet, so `tsc` can't run. Verify logic by executing a
type-stripped mirror in node (`/tmp/*.mjs`) covering the LeetCode examples + adversarial
edges. Every committed solution must pass its checks.

## Git

- Direct push to `main` is blocked by a guard hook — always work on a branch and open a PR.
- Conventional commits (`feat:`, `docs:`, `fix:`…).
- Each note is added to the README **Notes** index table and, if it's a new family, the folder tree.
