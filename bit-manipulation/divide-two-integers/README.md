# Divide by doubling

## TL;DR

**Is it the divide-by-doubling trick? Ask these — all yes → yes:**
1. **Forbidden from using `*` `/` `%`?** You must build the result from `+` and `-` only.
2. **Could the count/quotient be huge (up to ~2³¹)?** So looping one-at-a-time would be billions of steps — too slow.
3. **Can I double a chunk/step and subtract the biggest that fits, instead of stepping by one?** If the step can grow `×2` each round and you commit the biggest that still fits → yes. **This one is the decider.**

**Before you code, pin down:** what's the clamp range / which exact value overflows (`INT_MIN / -1`)? truncate toward zero or floor? can the divisor be `0`? is this language's `<<` fixed-width (JS = 32-bit)?

**The lines where bugs hide** (details in *How it works*):
double with `+`, **not** `<<` (32-bit overflow → infinite loop) · the `INT_MIN / -1` clamp · the sign when exactly one input is negative.

## What it is
Dividing `dividend ÷ divisor` is really one question: **how many times does the
divisor fit inside the dividend?** Here you must answer it using only `+`, `−`, and
comparisons — no `*`, `/`, or `%`.

The slow way: subtract the divisor over and over and count. For `43 ÷ 3` that's
3, 6, 9, … one step at a time — up to billions of steps for big numbers.

The trick: count in **doubling jumps** instead of one at a time. Start with one
divisor, then keep doubling it — 1 divisor, then 2, then 4, then 8, … (each jump is
just the previous one added to itself). Every round, take the **biggest jump that
still fits** in what's left, subtract it, write down how many divisors that jump was
worth, then repeat on the leftover.

`43 ÷ 3`, round by round:
- `24` (that's 8 threes) fits in 43 → leftover `19`
- `12` (4 threes) fits in 19 → leftover `7`
- `6` (2 threes) fits in 7 → leftover `1`
- `1` is smaller than 3 → stop. Answer = `8 + 4 + 2 = 14`.

> Built on: **Bit Manipulation** (doubling a number = `×2`). The one idea: don't
> subtract the divisor one at a time — subtract it in big doubling jumps (1×, 2×, 4×,
> 8× the divisor, always the biggest that fits) and add up how many divisors each jump
> was worth. Those counts add up to the answer.

## What you track
- `a` — what's left to divide (works on the absolute value).
- `b` — the divisor (absolute value).
- `temp` — the current chunk (`b` doubled some number of times).
- `multiple` — what that chunk is worth (`2^k`).
- `result` — the quotient being summed up.
- `sign` — computed once from the two inputs.

## How it works
Pseudocode. The three ⚠️ lines are where every bug hides — read those slowly; the
rest is filler.

```
if dividend == INT_MIN and divisor == -1:
    return INT_MAX          // ⚠️ THE clamp. This is the one quotient that
                            //    overflows 32-bit (2^31 doesn't fit). Without
                            //    this guard it wraps to a wrong negative.

sign = (dividend < 0) XOR (divisor < 0)   // ⚠️ negative only when EXACTLY one
                                          //    input is negative; two negatives
                                          //    cancel. Get this wrong → wrong sign.
a = |dividend|
b = |divisor|
result = 0

while a >= b:
    temp     = b            // current chunk = b * 2^k
    multiple = 1            // ...worth this many divisors (2^k)

    while a >= temp + temp:       // ⚠️ double with temp + temp , NEVER temp << 1.
        temp     += temp          //    In JS `<<` is 32-bit SIGNED. Once temp hits
        multiple += multiple      //    2^30, temp<<1 leaves the signed range and two
                                  //    more shifts COLLAPSE temp to 0 (2^30 → -2^31
                                  //    → 0). Then 0<<1 stays 0, so `a >= temp<<1` is
                                  //    true forever → INFINITE LOOP. `+` is safe:
                                  //    JS numbers are 64-bit floats, exact past 2^31.

    a      -= temp          // take the biggest chunk that fit
    result += multiple      // bank its worth

return sign ? -result : result
```

**Why doubling makes it fast (the part to slow down for):** after the inner loop,
`temp` is the largest `b × 2^k` that's `≤ a`. Each chunk is found in ~log steps, and
there are ~log chunks → about `O(log² n)` (roughly "number of doublings, squared").
That's **not** near-O(1): it only stays small because the **input is capped at 32
bits**, so the number of doublings is ≤ ~32 and the whole thing is ≤ ~32×32 ≈ 1024
steps. Compare ~2 billion for one-at-a-time subtraction.

Lock these three in and it can't loop forever, overflow, or flip sign:
**double with `+` not `<<`**, **the `INT_MIN / -1` clamp**, **the sign when exactly one input is negative.**

## Where you'll meet it (practice + recognition)

**On LeetCode (and similar platforms):**
- **#29 Divide Two Integers** — divide without `*`, `/`, `%`, truncate toward zero, clamp to 32-bit. The inner loop doubles `b` to find the biggest `b × 2^k ≤ a`, subtracts it, and adds `2^k` to the quotient (this note's code).
- **#50 Pow(x, n)** — fast power by repeated doubling/squaring: instead of multiplying `x` by itself `n` times, square the base and halve the exponent. Same "grow the step `×2` each round" idea, applied to exponents instead of a quotient.

**Real life / other platforms:**
- **Exponential ("galloping") search** — double a probe index until the value there overshoots the target, then binary-search the bracket you just pinned down. Finds a bound in a huge, unbounded, or paginated sorted source without scanning linearly.
- **Fixed-point math on hardware with no integer divide** — build division out of shifts/adds because the chip has no divide instruction.

**Looks like it but ISN'T:** a plain `x << 1` used as a fast `×2` is **not** this trick — that's just a single bit op, no doubling loop, no "biggest chunk that fits". And note **exponential search = this note's doubling + binary search composed**: the doubling loop pins the bracket, then binary search finishes inside it (the sibling trick — see [`../../binary-search/find-target/README.md`](../../binary-search/find-target/README.md)).
